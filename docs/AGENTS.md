# AGENT Guidelines for Documentation (docs/)

This file applies to everything under `docs/`.

- Keep documentation concise, actionable, and written in plain English.
- When documenting configuration, mirror the current defaults and option names found in `public/index.html` so guidance stays accurate.
- Avoid embedding or linking binary assets in this folder.
- Prefer lists and code blocks for steps the reader should follow; include copy-pasteable commands where relevant.
