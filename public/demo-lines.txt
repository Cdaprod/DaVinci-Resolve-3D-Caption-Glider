Infrastructure is a narrative.
This repo tells it in code.

Idempotent builds.
Deterministic outputs.
Auditable artifacts.

Logs are not noise.
They’re provenance.

Networks are not wiring.
They’re policy.

Containers are not apps.
They’re contracts.

Version everything.
Even your assumptions.

Welcome to the repo.
This isn’t a slideshow -- it’s a build log.
Every commit is a camera move.
Every line is a decision.

I don’t "store files".
I build systems that remember.
Objects become evidence.
Metadata becomes truth.

MinIO for the lake.
Weaviate for recall.
LangGraph for orchestration.
Everything containerized.
Everything reproducible.

The pipeline is simple:
ingest → enrich → index → search → ship.
No magic.
Just engineering.

This is my edge stack.
Raspberry Pi as the capture node.
Desktop as the render node.
Phone as the remote control.

The demo you’re watching?
Generated from the same code.
Words are geometry.
Timing is data.
Motion is a function.

If you can read it --
you can run it.
If you can run it --
you can fork it.
