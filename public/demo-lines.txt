I was always told I had potential.  
That awareness never left me, but at some point it stopped being hope and became fuel for fallacies.  
Fallacies about how I had missed my chance, wasted too much time, and left behind any real version of who I could have been or thought I should have been.

One of the first places I fed those fallacies was in a burn clinic after an accident.  
Looking back now, I realize the surrender happened long before I ever ended up there.  
By the time my skin needed repairing, my ideals were already gone.

When someone has no desire or duty to follow a direction in life, they do not drift accidentally.  
They choose an alternate path, even if it is negative, as long as it is intentional.

I used to believe the problem was the crowd I kept.  
That I was influenced, misled, or pulled into something I never intended to be part of.  
But the truth is I wasn’t dragged into that life.  
I dove into it willingly.

I traded innocence for future stories.  
Stories I thought would someday justify the damage.

Now, nearly two decades later, I can tell those stories.  
I simply choose not to.  
Because when I look back, I don’t just see my own fall.  
I see the faces of people who didn’t survive it.

That’s when I understood I wasn’t only shaped by circumstance.  
I pulled others down with me.

The first time I remember lying to myself, and it having lasting consequences, was in a hospital bed.  
My mother and father were there, along with a doctor preparing to clean third-degree burns covered in dirt and leaves.

That doctor raised concerns about my tolerance to prescription medication.  
Concerns that the anesthesia I needed might not work.

When that was explained to me, I stood at a decision I didn’t recognize as important.  
I could be honest, or I could protect myself from disappointment.  
I chose silence.

I didn’t know then that silence could become a skill.

The anesthesia failed.  
Two people worked on either side of me, scrubbing burned skin from my chest and abdomen.  
In my memory, it feels like steel wool.

That moment haunts me, but it is nothing compared to what came next.  
That pain was temporary.  
The pain that followed was not.

Up until then, I told myself I was using recreationally.  
That belief ended in that hospital bed.

Burns hurt, but knowing what I know now, I would have chosen pain over numbness.  
I can’t tell where the injury ended and withdrawal began.

Nothing I have experienced since compares to the physical and mental suffering of addiction.  
It twists pain into something endless.

So I ran.  
I ran into a world parents pray their children never encounter.

Armed with lies that sounded logical, I took from anyone willing to give.  
Friends, strangers, and eventually my own family.

Danger felt like momentum.  
Deception felt like belonging.

I charged forward recklessly into a world of decay built on the backs of people like me who came before.  
They welcomed me as I disappeared further.

Every bridge I burned made the grave deeper.  
That life lasted a decade.

Very few of the people beside me survived it.  
Through all of it, one thing never changed.  
My family’s love.

I carried it like weight, while they carried me without condition.

In 2013, someone said the word triplets.  
Three lives, three futures.

My first thought was not joy or fear.  
It was calculation.  
How will this affect my ability to keep using.

By then I knew the system.  
Rehab, jail, and back again.

My body showed the cost.  
Hollow cheeks, scarred arms, and a stare that scared people.

The boys came early.  
Kayson, Kayne, and Kole.

Our families stepped in and did the real parenting.  
They let us pretend.

But addiction cannot raise children.

Authorities were notified, families were trusted, and we were told to leave.  
When I walked away from my childhood home, my newborn sons, and my parents, I felt almost nothing.

Drugs dull the right emotions and sharpen the wrong ones.

Months passed with the same routines, the same hunger, and the same sickness.  
Then one night, I finally stopped long enough to hear a voice I had buried.

My conscience spoke for the first time in ten years.

It didn’t shout or plead.  
It told me the truth.

You had good parents and a father who loved you.  
You are failing three children who don’t even know it yet.

Out here, in prison, or dead, those are the options.  
Choose now or never.

No one is coming to save you.  
You save yourself.

Do one thing right for someone other than you.

I picked up my phone and called Cato.  
I trusted him not to steal my car.

I said drive me to Atlanta, I’m checking into rehab.

This time was different.  
Not easier, but clearer.  
Purpose changes pain.

Ten years later, I still carry a hundred-dollar bill saved for him.  
It isn’t about the ride.  
It’s about the ones who never made it out.

About the fixes we prayed would save us and never did.

Giving him that money wasn’t repayment.  
It was closure and hope handed forward.

Maybe it made him believe there was another way.

Cato disappeared for a while, just like I once did.  
Then one day, he saw me.

I gave him the bill and told him why.

Not long after, I heard the news.  
He got clean.

I smiled to myself.  
Yeah, I meant to do that.
