#demo-lines-story-version

#C As a kid I was always told I had potential.
[PAUSE=160]
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default That awareness never left me, but at some point it stopped being hope and became fuel for fallacies.
[PAUSE=140]
Fallacies about how I had missed my chance, wasted too much time, and left behind any real version of who I could have been or thought I should have been.
[BREAK]

#A One of the first places I fed those fallacies was in a burn clinic after an accident.
[PAUSE=160]
Looking back now, I realize the surrender happened long before I ever ended up there.
By the time my skin needed repairing, my ideals were already gone.
[BREAK]

#default When someone has no desire or duty to follow a direction in life, they do not drift accidentally.
They choose an alternate path, even if it is negative, as long as it is intentional.
[BREAK]

#A I used to believe the problem was the crowd I kept.
That I was influenced, misled, or pulled into something I never intended to be part of.
[PAUSE=120]
#B But the **truth** is I wasn’t dragged into that life.
[HOLD=220]
#B I dove into it willingly.
[BREAK]

#default I traded innocence for future stories.
Stories I thought would someday justify the damage.
[BREAK]

#C Now, nearly two decades later, I can tell those stories.
I simply choose not to.
[PAUSE=140]
Because when I look back, I don’t just see my own fall.
I see the faces of people who didn’t survive it.
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default That’s when I understood I wasn’t only shaped by circumstance.
#B I pulled others down with me.
[BREAK]

#A The first time I remember lying to myself, and it having lasting consequences, was in a hospital bed.
My mother and father were there, along with a doctor preparing to clean third-degree burns covered in dirt and leaves.
[BREAK]

#default That doctor raised concerns about my tolerance to prescription medication.
Concerns that the anesthesia I needed might not work.
[BREAK]

#A When that was explained to me, I stood at a decision I didn’t recognize as important.
I could be honest, or I could protect myself from disappointment.
#B I chose silence.
[HOLD=220]
[BREAK]

#default I didn’t know then that silence could become a skill.
[BREAK]

#A The anesthesia failed.
Two people worked on either side of me, scrubbing burned skin from my chest and abdomen.
In my memory, it feels like steel wool.
[BREAK]

#default That moment haunts me, but it is nothing compared to what came next.
That pain was temporary.
#C The pain that followed was not.
[HOLD=220]
[BREAK]

#default Up until then, I told myself I was using recreationally.
That belief ended in that hospital bed.
[BREAK]

#A Burns hurt, but knowing what I know now, I would have chosen pain over numbness.
I can’t tell where the injury ended and withdrawal began.
[BREAK]

#default Nothing I have experienced since compares to the physical and mental suffering of addiction.
It twists pain into something endless.
[BREAK]

#B So I ran.
I ran into a world parents pray their children never encounter.
[BREAK]

#default Armed with lies that sounded logical, I took from anyone willing to give.
Friends, strangers, and eventually my own family.
[BREAK]

#default Danger felt like momentum.
Deception felt like belonging.
[BREAK]

#B I charged forward recklessly into a world of decay built on the backs of people like me who came before.
They welcomed me as I disappeared further.
[BREAK]

#default Every bridge I burned made the grave deeper.
That life lasted a decade.
[BREAK]

#default Very few of the people beside me survived it.
Through all of it, one thing never changed.
#C My family’s love.
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default I carried it like weight, while they carried me without condition.
[BREAK]

#A In 2013, someone said the word triplets.
Three lives, three futures.
[BREAK]

#default My first thought was not joy or fear.
#B It was calculation.
How will this affect my ability to keep using.
[BREAK]

#default By then I knew the system.
Rehab, jail, and back again.
[BREAK]

#default My body showed the cost.
Hollow cheeks, scarred arms, and a stare that scared people.
[BREAK]

#A The boys came early.
Kayson, Kayne, and Kole.
[BREAK]

#default Our families stepped in and did the real parenting.
They let us pretend.
[BREAK]

#B But addiction cannot raise children.
[HOLD=220]
[BREAK]

#default Authorities were notified, families were trusted, and we were told to leave.
When I walked away from my childhood home, my newborn sons, and my parents, I felt almost nothing.
[BREAK]

#default Drugs dull the right emotions and sharpen the wrong ones.
[BREAK]

#A Months passed with the same routines, the same hunger, and the same sickness.
Then one night, I finally stopped long enough to hear a voice I had buried.
[BREAK]

#C My conscience spoke for the first time in ten years.
[PAUSE=140]
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default It didn’t shout or plead.
It told me the truth.
[BREAK]

#B You had good parents and a father who loved you.
You are failing three children who don’t even know it yet.
[BREAK]

#default Out here, in prison, or dead, those are the options.
#B Choose now or never.
[HOLD=220]
[BREAK]

#default No one is coming to save you.
#B You save yourself.
[BREAK]

#default Do one thing right for someone other than you.
[BREAK]

#A I picked up my phone and called Cato.
I trusted him not to steal my car.
[BREAK]

#B I said drive me to Atlanta, I’m checking into rehab.
[HOLD=220]
[BREAK]

#default This time was different.
Not easier, but clearer.
#C Purpose changes pain.
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default Ten years later, I still carry a hundred-dollar bill saved for him.
It isn’t about the ride.
It’s about the ones who never made it out.
[BREAK]

#default About the fixes we prayed would save us and never did.
[BREAK]

#A Giving him that money wasn’t repayment.
It was closure and hope handed forward.
[BREAK]

#default Maybe it made him believe there was another way.
[BREAK]

#default Cato disappeared for a while, just like I once did.
Then one day, he saw me.
[BREAK]

#A I gave him the bill and told him why.
[BREAK]

#default Not long after, I heard the news.
#C He got clean.
[HOLD=240]
[BREAK]

#default I smiled to myself.
#B Yeah, I meant to do that.
[HOLD=260]
