#default So what you’re looking at right now,
is actually the overhead camera.
[PAUSE=180]

This little camera right here — this is an OBSBOT Tiny 2.
It’s mounted above my desk, looking straight down at the workspace.
[PAUSE=200]

#A And yeah, I know — it’s kind of funny that you’re watching a camera...
...from another camera.
[PAUSE=220]

#default But for what I’m doing, this thing is honestly.**perfect**
[PAUSE=180]

All I really need here is access to a sensor,
A reliable sensor,
Something that can see the workspace, track movement, and just work.
[BR=1]

#A I don’t need cinema glass for this angle,
I don’t need shallow depth of field,
I need **coverage**.
[PAUSE=220]

#default And for that, this is actually a really solid piece of hardware.
[PAUSE=160]

It gives me a clean overhead view,
it stays out of the way,
and it lets me focus on the actual work,
instead of babysitting the camera.
[BR=1]

#B So when you see this angle later on in the video,
this is what it is — it’s the **procedural view**.
[PAUSE=200]

It’s here to show you exactly what I’m doing,
step by step.
[HOLD=280]

[BREAK]

#default Now… when it comes to projects,
anyone in their right mind could look at my schedule and say.
[PAUSE=200]

#B "What the hell is this guy doing?"
[HOLD=320]

#default And honestly — that reaction makes sense,
if you don’t see the system behind it.
[PAUSE=240]

[BREAK]

#default But there **is** a systematic approach to what I’m doing.
[PAUSE=180]

The long-term goal is simple:
I want to make a **cinematic documentary**.
[PAUSE=220]

#A But you don’t just jump straight into that,
Everything you’re seeing right now —
every side project, every upgrade —
it’s all building toward being able to do that properly.
[PAUSE=260]

[BREAK]

#default So how does all of this lead into a documentary?
[PAUSE=200]

#B I’ll just say it plainly:
we’re going to make the documentary,
using our **own software**.
[PAUSE=260]

Software we’re building from scratch.
[HOLD=300]

[BREAK]

#default What we’re actually building is a platform as a service —
one that represents the ideal filmmaker,
and editor workflow,
end-to-end.
[PAUSE=240]

Capture
Monitoring
Storage
Organization
Editing
Automation
All in one system
[BR=2]

[BREAK]

#default And to bring this full circle to what we’re doing today,
we’re upgrading the hardware,
that powers our backend camera agents.
[PAUSE=240]

#A Right now, we’re using Raspberry Pis,
with USB capture card dongles,
And they work.
[PAUSE=180]

#B But working isn’t the same as **designed**.
[HOLD=320]

[BREAK]

#default These two boxes right here are upgrades.
[PAUSE=160]

One is an M2 expansion board,
The other is a dedicated capture card HAT.
[PAUSE=200]

[BREAK]

#default We’re moving our existing single-slot M2 board,
from the top of the Raspberry Pi,
to the bottom — out of the way —
and that immediately gives us an additional M2 slot.
[PAUSE=260]

#A More importantly,
it lets us move away from a cheap HDMI-to-USB capture dongle,
and into a CSI ribbon-based camera capture system.
[PAUSE=260]

That gives us HDMI-in,
HDMI-out,
and full HDMI passthrough --
all handled at the board level.
[BR=2]

[BREAK]

#default Now here’s the important part:
the NVMe storage isn’t being used to store media.
[PAUSE=220]

#B It’s being used as a **cache buffer**.
[HOLD=300]

[BREAK]

#default This Raspberry Pi runs a capture daemon —
a supervised backend service —
that uses NVMe as high-speed buffering,
so we can rescue dropped frames,
before and after sending video over the network,
to our central API gateway,
and media services.
[PAUSE=320]

[BREAK]

#A Because let’s be honest:
the whole point of this system,
is to eliminate memory cards entirely.
[PAUSE=260]

No more copying files,
No more manual archiving,
No more juggling cards,
between cameras and computers.
[BR=2]

[BREAK]

#default Everything lives inside our platform’s browser UI.
[PAUSE=200]

Camera monitoring
Camera controls
Digital asset management
Built-in timelines
Effects
SRT captions
And AI-assisted tooling layered on top
[BR=2]

[BREAK]

#default People hear all of that and say,
[PAUSE=120]

#B "That sounds like a lot"
[HOLD=300]

#default But when everything lives in one place,
it just comes down to **implementation**.
[PAUSE=240]

#C This is the same idea —
just built for how I actually **work**.
